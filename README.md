## Usage

Run python plex_poster_set_helper.py in a terminal, using one of the following options:

### Command Line Arguments

The script supports various command-line arguments for flexible use.

1. **Launch the GUI**  
   Use the gui argument to open the graphical user interface:
   
   ```bash
   python plex_poster_set_helper.py gui
   ```

2. **Single Link Import**  
   Provide a link directly to set posters from a single MediUX or ThePosterDB set:
   
   ```bash
   python plex_poster_set_helper.py https://mediux.pro/sets/9242
   ```

3. **Bulk Import**  
   Import multiple links from a .txt file using the bulk argument:
   
   ```bash
   python plex_poster_set_helper.py bulk bulk_import.txt
   ```

   - The .txt file should contain one URL per line. Lines starting with # or // will be ignored as comments.

   - **If no text file parameter is provided, it will use the default value from config.json for bulk_txt.**


## Supported Features

### Interactive CLI Mode

If no command-line arguments are provided, the script will enter an interactive CLI mode, where you can select from menu options to perform various tasks:

- **Option 1:** Enter a ThePosterDB set URL, MediUX set URL, or ThePosterDB user URL to set posters for individual items or entire user collections.
- **Option 2:** Run a bulk import by specifying the path to a `.txt` file containing multiple URLs (or simply press `Enter` to use the default bulk file defined in `config.json`).
- **Option 3:** Launch the GUI for a graphical interface.
- **Option 4:** Stop the program and exit.

When using bulk import, if no file path is specified, the script will default to the file provided in the `config.json` under the `bulk_txt` key. Each URL in the `.txt` file should be on a separate line, and any lines starting with `#` or `//` will be ignored as comments.

### GUI Mode

The GUI provides a more user-friendly interface for managing poster uploads. Users can run the script with python plex_poster_set_helper.py gui to launch the CustomTkinter-based interface, where they can:
- Easily enter single or bulk URLs.
- View progress, status updates, and more in an intuitive layout.

### Multiple Libraries

To target multiple Plex libraries, modify config.json as follows:

```json
"tv_library": ["TV Shows", "Kids TV Shows"],
"movie_library": ["Movies", "Kids Movies"]
```

Using these options, the tool will apply posters to the same media in all specified libraries.

### Bulk Import

1. Use the bulk argument to import your default `bulk_text` file specified in `config.json`.
2. Or, specify the path to a .txt file containing URLs as a second argument. Each URL will be processed to set posters for the corresponding media.

### Filters

The mediux_filters option in config.json allows you to control which media types get posters:
- show_cover: Upload covers for TV shows.
- background: Upload background images.
- season_cover: Set posters for each season.
- title_card: Add title cards.

## Executable Build

In the `dist/` directory, you'll find the compiled executable for Windows: `Plex Poster Set Helper.zip`. This executable allows you to run the tool without needing to have Python installed.

To rebuild the executable:

*Note: Prior to building, set the `interactive_cli` boolean to False on line `20` to ensure the executable launches in GUI Mode by default*

1. Install PyInstaller if you don't have it already:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. Use the provided spec file (`_PlexPosterSetHelper.spec`) to build the executable:

   ```bash
   pyinstaller _PlexPosterSetHelper.spec
   ```

This will create the executable along with the necessary files.
